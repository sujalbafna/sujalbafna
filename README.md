### Projects

Here are some of my favorite projects:

- [Project 1]([https://github.com/sujalbafna/project1](https://github.com/sujalbafna/Medicine-Management-Store)): MediTrack Pro is a secure and user-friendly medicine management system that streamlines inventory tracking, provides low-stock and expiry alerts, and offers advanced search options. Designed for efficiency and accuracy, it ensures seamless medical inventory management with robust user authentication.
- [Project 2]([https://github.com/sujalbafna/project2](https://github.com/sujalbafna/Safira)): The Women’s Safety Detection System is a real-time AI-based application designed to enhance women's safety using computer vision and gesture detection. The system utilizes face detection, gender classification, and hand gesture recognition (SOS gesture) to detect potentially unsafe situations. It also identifies if a female is surrounded by multiple males or is alone during night hours. Alerts are triggered based on these conditions, contributing to a safer environment.
- [Project 3]([https://sdsforklifttraining.com/]): SDS Forklift Training offers professional training programs for forklift operators, including Defensive Driving, Counterbalance Forklift, Bendi Operator, High Reach Truck, and more. With a focus on safety, skill development, and certification, we empower individuals and businesses to meet industry standards efficiently and effectively.
- [Project 4]([https://github.com/sujalbafna/Timely-Tables]): This project automates the creation of academic timetables for educational institutions, ensuring conflict-free scheduling of subjects, faculties, and labs across multiple divisions. The program allows users to input division names, time slots, subjects, and faculties, then generates randomized yet balanced timetables that avoid faculty overlaps. Timetables are displayed in the console for quick review and saved as a formatted Excel file, featuring color coding for easy interpretation—yellow for lunch breaks, green for lab sessions, and blue for regular subjects. With its user-friendly interface and robust scheduling logic, this tool simplifies timetable management. It requires Python and libraries like pandas and openpyxl for operation. Users can clone the repository, run the script, and follow on-screen prompts to create and export timetables effortlessly.
